                <!--Tool competition slides <a href=""> <img src="../img/pdf.png" style="width:20px;height:20px;"> </a>-->
                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>NLP-based approaches and tools have been proposed to improve the efficiency of software engineers, processes, and products, by automatically processing natural language artifacts (issues, emails, commits, etc.).</p>

                <p>We believe that the availability of accurate tools is becoming increasingly necessary to improve Software Engineering (SE) processes. Two important processes are (i) issue management and prioritization and (ii) code comment classification where developers have to understand, classify, prioritize, assign, etc. incoming issues and code comments reported by end-users and developers.</p>

							  <p>We are pleased to announce the second edition of the NLBSE'23 tool competition on <b>issue report classification</b> and, for the first time on <b>code comment classification</b>; two important tasks in issue and code comment management and prioritization.</p>

                <p>You are invited to participate in one or both tool competitions.</p>

                <h3 id="issue-report-classification">Issue Report Classification</h3>
                <p>
                 The issue report classification competition consists of building and assessing a
			<b>multi-class classification model</b> to classify issue reports
			as belonging to one category
			representing the type of information
			they convey.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We provide a dataset encompassing more than <b>1.4 million</b> labeled issue reports
			(as bugs, enhancements, questions, and documentation)
			extracted from real open-source projects.
                  You are invited to leverage this dataset
			to evaluate your proposed approache(s)
			and compare your achieved results against
			our baselines (based on FastText and RoBERTa).
                </p>
                <p>
                  You must train, tune and evaluate your multi-class classification model(s)
			using the provided training and test sets.
			To access these datasets as well as the competition's rules and baselines,
			please check out our
			<b><a href="https://github.com/nlbse2023/issue-report-classification">repository</a></b>.
		</p>

                <!-- <h6>Competition overview</h6> -->


                <!-- <p>The submissions will be ranked based on the multi-class F1 score (micro-averaged) achieved by the proposed classifiers on the test set, as indicated in the papers.</p> -->

							  <!-- <p>The submission with the highest F1 score will be the winner of the competition.</p> -->

                <h6>Updates</h6>

                <p>Compared to the <a href="https://nlbse2022.github.io/tools/">2022 version</a>
			of the issue report competition, we have made the following changes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>we have increased the size of the competition dataset from 800K to 1.4M issue reports,</li>
                  <li>a new category labeled as 'documentation' is added to the dataset,</li>
                  <li>we included synonyms of labels in the new dataset,</li>
                  <li>we removed multi-label issues from the dataset,</li>
                  <li>similarly, we removed non-english issues from the dataset, and finally</li>
                  <li>we added a Transformer-based (RoBERTa) baseline to this round.</li>
               </ul>

	       <p>The issue report classification competition is organized by: <b>Rafael Kallis</b> (<a href="mailto:rk@rafaelkallis.com">rk@rafaelkallis.com</a>) and <b>Maliheh Izadi</b> (<a href="mailto:m.izadi@tudelft.nl">m.izadi@tudelft.nl</a>).</p>

               <h3 id="code-comment-classification">Code Comment Classification</h3>
               <p>
                The code comment classification competition consists of building and testing <b>a set of binary classifiers</b> to classify class comment sentences as belonging to one or more categories representing the types of information that a sentence is conveying.
               </p>
               <p>
                For the competition, we provide a dataset of <b>6738</b> class comment sentences and <b>19</b> baseline classifiers based on the Random Forest model. Participants will propose their classifiers for this task to outperform the baselines.
               </p>

               <p>
                  You must train, tune and evaluate your binary classifiers using the provided training and test sets.
                  We created a <b><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cW8iUPY9rTjZdXnGYtJ4ARBSISyKieWt">notebook</a></b> and <b><a href="https://github.com/nlbse2023/code-comment-classification">repository</a></b> with information about the code comment classification competition including dataset, rules, baselines, and results.
                </p>

		<p>The code comment classification competition is organized by: <b>Pooja Rani</b> (<a href="mailto:rani@ifi.uzh.ch">rani@ifi.uzh.ch</a>), <b>Oscar Chaparro</b> (<a href="mailto:oscarch@wm.edu">oscarch@wm.edu</a>) and <b>Luca Pascarella</b> (<a href="mailto:lpascarella@ethz.ch">lpascarella@ethz.ch</a>).</p>

               <!-- <h6>Competition overview</h6> -->

               <!-- <p>
                Since participants will submit a set of binary classifiers, the submissions will be ranked based on the number of classifiers that outperform the baselines by F1 score. Such performance must be computed on the test set.
               </p> -->

               <!-- <p>
                The submission with the highest count of classifiers with higher F1 scores than the baselines will be the <b>winner of the competition</b>. In the case of ties, the highest average of F1 scores across <b>all 19</b> (7 for Java, 7 for Pharo, and 5 for Python) binary classifiers will declare the winner.
               </p> -->

               <!-- <p>
                The reported F1 scores and count of outperforming classifiers in the paper will be used to rank the participants.
               </p> -->

							<h6>Issue Report Classification</h6>
              <p>
                Participants will submit one or more multi-class classifiers and the submissions will be ranked based on the F1 score (micro-averaged) achieved by the proposed classifiers on the <a href="https://github.com/nlbse2023/issue-report-classification">issue report test set</a>, as indicated in the papers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The submission with the highest F1 score will be the <b>winner</b> of the issue report classification competition.
              </p>

              <h6>Code Comment Classification</h6>
              <p>
                Since participants will submit a set of binary classifiers (based on a single ML/DL model -- see more details in our <b><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cW8iUPY9rTjZdXnGYtJ4ARBSISyKieWt">notebook</a></b>), we will use a formula to rank the competition submissions and determine a winner.
              </p>


              <p>
                  The formula, specified in our <b><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cW8iUPY9rTjZdXnGYtJ4ARBSISyKieWt">notebook</a></b> , accounts for: (1) the overall averaged F1 score achieved by the classifiers, and (2) the proportion of classifiers that improve the baseline classifiers. Essentially, we encourage participants to improve as many baseline classifiers as  possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                 The reported F1 scores and count of outperforming classifiers in the paper will be used to rank the participants.
              </p>

<!--          <p><strong>Java tool competition</strong>: As for recent years, we invite researchers to participate in the competition with their unit test generation tool for <strong><em>Java</em></strong>. Tools will be evaluated against a benchmark with respect to code coverage and mutation score.</p>-->

<!--    <p><strong>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) testing competition</strong>: In addition to the traditional Java tool competition, we also organize a CPS testing competition on self-driving cars simulation environments. Specifically, in collaboration with the <a href="https://beamng.gmbh/research/ " target="_blank">BeamNG research team</a>, this competition focuses on the generation of scenarios using BeamNG self-driving cars simulator.-->
